          <p>Hi! Everyone calls called me Juny or Junjun. I have been inlove with videogames eversince I was a child
              and I was to interested with how technology works. Right now I currently have one daughter and since then my 
              time playing video games and watching anime has been highly decreased. I still find time though to enjoy my hobbies and
              aside from that I also go out to the gym and let my stress go away. I am currently a Third Year College Student in La Salle University - Ozamiz City.
              Taking up the course BS in Information Technology.
